      		<h1>Evolutionary Ecologist</h1>
  			     <p>
                I'm interested in questions at the frontier between <b>ecology</b> and <b>evolution</b>.
                In the last years, I was looking at potential <b>evolutionary responses</b> in animal populations facing <b>environmental changes</b>, more specifically with phenotypic plasticity, population genetics ad quantitative genetics.
              </p>
            <h3>Actually</h3>
            <p>
              I'm a research professional at <a href="https://qcbs.ca/">Quebec Centre for Biodiversity Science</a> (QCBS) and at <a href="http://cret-recherche.weebly.com/">Research Centre in Terrestial Ecology</a> (CRET), at Universit√© de Sherbrooke.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every day, I'm helping researchers and students in their diverse research projets.
            </p>
            <h3>Bioinformatics</h3>
            <p>
              An huge part of my tasks is to answer statistical and programming questions, most often in <b>R</b>.
              I really appreciated more and more complex programming challenges, and I would like to add this complexity to my own research interests, for example through the integration of genomic aspects.
